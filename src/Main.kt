/*
* Part 2. Concepts
*
* - Pairs & triples
*   + Groups of two to three pieces of data
*   + Can represent classes or structured data
* - Collections
*   + Single construct which can hold multiple values of the same type
*   + Can work with any type
*   + Can be iterated over
*   + type of collections
*     * Array
*     * List
*     * Set (no duplicated)
*     * Map (a dictionary)
*   + Generics<?>
*     * Classes & functions operating on yet undefined types
*     * Types are determined when creating objects
*     * Generics examples
*          public fun <T>List(size: Int): List<T>
*          class Container<T>(val value: T)
*          val namesList = List<String>(10)
* - Mutability
*
* - Collection performance
